**Supplementary Figures** 

Supplementary Figure 1. RNA protocols are compared for gene-level exon log-CPM (left) and gene-level intron log-CPM values (right) for human cell line HCC827 R1, R2, R3, human cell line NCI-H11975 R1, R2, and R3 (in order of plots shown).

Supplementary Figure 2. From left to right, intron versus exon log-CPM, intron versus exon log-RPKM, intron log-RPKM versus total intron length, relative coverage between exon and intron regions versus total intron length, and relative coverage versus exon log-RPKM; with poly(A) RNA (top row) and Total RNA libraries (bottom row). The plots are displayed for human cell line HCC827 R1, R2, R3, human cell line NCI-H11975 R1, R2, and R3 (in order of plots shown).
